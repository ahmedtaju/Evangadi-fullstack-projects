# Evangadi-fullstack-projects
This repository contains my MERN stack exercise codes and projects completed during my Full Stack Web Development course at Evangadi Tech. It showcases my progress in learning MySQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, along with hands-on projects that demonstrate practical application of these technologies.
